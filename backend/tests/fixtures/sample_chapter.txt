Chapter 1: The Beginning

Jake opened his eyes. The system notification hung in the air before him,
glowing with an ethereal blue light. He read the words carefully.

"Welcome to the tutorial," a voice said. Jake felt the world shift around him.
The forest stretched endlessly in every direction, ancient trees towering above.
He looked around, taking in the sprawling landscape that seemed to stretch for
miles. Massive oaks, their trunks wider than houses, reached towards a sky that
shimmered with strange colors he had never seen before. The air itself felt
different here — charged with energy, with mana, with power waiting to be
tapped.

He took a deep breath and stepped forward. His boots crunched against fallen
leaves and twigs. Somewhere in the distance, something howled. This was only
the start of his journey through the multiverse, and he intended to make it
count. Every step brought new sensations, new understanding of the system that
governed this world.

Jake nodded and stepped forward into the darkness. The creatures within
stirred at his approach, sensing fresh prey entering their domain. Shadows
moved along the walls, shapes twisting and reforming into nightmarish forms
that tested his resolve. He gripped his weapon tighter and pressed on,
determined to prove himself worthy of the power the system had granted him.
The trial would not be easy, but nothing worth having ever was.
